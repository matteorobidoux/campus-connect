# CampusConnect

by Silicon Squad

## Our goal

We are students from Dawson which are tired with the experience of Omnivox. Therefore, we have take the matter into our own hands and decided to revamp completely Omnivox, making it modern and adapted to nowadays students.

## How to run it?

1. Install the dependencies:
   `npm run install:all`
2. Start the project
   `npm run start`

## Features

- Get quick access to the classes you have
- Add events to the calendar
- Responsive and modern UI

## Known Bugs

- As of now, we do not serve the website through Express, we rather run it from the client app since we do not have any API endpoints defined.
- Our website is not deployed for now as we have issues since our app for the preliminary sprint did not have the same folder structure. Therefore, we had to go through a different process of deploying on Azure.
